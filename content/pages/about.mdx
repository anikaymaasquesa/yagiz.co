Hello there! My name is Yagiz Nizipli, and I'm a member of the Node.js Core team and the OpenJS Foundation.

I'm a passionate software engineer with years of experience in building scalable and performant systems using Node.js and other modern technologies. I'm particularly interested in optimizing and improving the performance of web applications and APIs, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others through talks, workshops, and blog posts. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing guitar or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
